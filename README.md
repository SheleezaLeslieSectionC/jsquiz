# JS Quiz

This quiz uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap to create an interactive user experience.

## Challenges

- Scoring system was difficult. Writing a function that keeps track of the score and resets at the end took some time.
- Keeping track of the correct answer first involved matching the string, but for future/changed use it made more sense to match it to a true/false value instead.
- Finding a way to make the quiz easily editable was difficult. At first, the questions were stores on the HTML page. But generating them through Javascript means that adding/deleting is as easy as changing the quiz object instead of the HTML.
- Handling resetting the quiz at the end through a reset function. At first it was a page refresh
- Populating HTML with Javascript was difficult at first. Became easier after properly breaking down each element into components and figuring out what needed to be added/altered first before appending
- Changing questions was at first removing and re-adding div. It was cumbersome and broken. While loop solved this problem
